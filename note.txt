harr cascade:
it is a pre-train Harr cascade classifier model, specially designed to detect Russian license plates in images and videos.
it is stored in an XML file format for easy loading and use with in opencv.

how it works?
Haar Features
The Model uses Haar-like Features, which are simple rectangular patterns that capture intensity differences within an image region.
These features are efficient for real-time object detection

cascade classifier
The classifier is organized as a cascade of stages, where each stage consists of a set of Haar featuers and thresholds.
An image region only passes to the next stage if it meets the critetian of the current stage.
This cascade struture allows for fast rejection on non-plate regions, focussing computation on potentital condidates.
